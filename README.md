# Shiny Training

This repository holds the materials required to be used in a future training session. The session guides participants through creating a web interface using Shiny in either R or Python and materials are also available in either English or French. As such, 4 copies of each script will be available.

TODO: translate this README into French also

## Set-up

Please join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):

-   A recent version of R, available at <https://cran.r-project.org>
-   A recent version of RStudio Desktop available at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop>
-   The following R packages, which you can install from the R console:

```         
pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "shiny", "deSolve")

install.packages(pkgs)
```

> **Note** If youâ€™re a Windows user and encounter an error message during installation noting a missing Rtools installation, install Rtools using the installer linked [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools).
